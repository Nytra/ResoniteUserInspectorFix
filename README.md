Distant Component Optimizer
=============================

Limits the update frequency of components that are too far away from you. Configurable.

This has been tested by a couple of people and the performance gains are pretty decent. I saw around +10 FPS in multiple worlds. You may get more or less depending on the world.

The main side effect of the mod is that animated things in the distance will stutter. This is normal.

As far as I know this doesn't break anything but there could still be unknown issues at this time.
